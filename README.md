# Correlation_Power_Analysis.
This project was done as an assignmet in a course "Attacks on Implementations of Secure Systems".

The instruction was as follows:

    A simulated AES implementation is waiting for you at the address:
    http://aoi.ise.bgu.ac.il/
    Your assignment is to discover the AES key using Correlation Power Analysis. You can get simulated side-channel traces for your attack from this URL, for the difficulty you choose:
    http://aoi.ise.bgu.ac.il/encrypt?user=yos&difficulty=1/
    You can verify your guess with using this address, which returns 1 if the password is correct:
    http://aoi.ise.bgu.ac.il/verify?user=yos&difficulty=1&key=2da963b3394ce9e9f2bba60f69281d83
    You should try to crack it under a minute with the highest difficulty possible.
